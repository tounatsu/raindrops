## Drawing Real-time Ray-tracing Raindrops on iOS 8

#### Introduction
* This demo app has been tested on Xcode iPhone 5s simulator & device.
* In this demo app, raindrops is randomly genereted and flows by the effect of gravity.
* This demo app is a small game, you can manipulate the speed of raindrops by gravity sensor, and avoid transparent raindrops get touched by those toxic (purple) ones. The longer you stayed the better.

#### To make it real:
* The change of speed could slightly deform the raindrops.
* Parametric equations are applied to generate the natural brim of raindrops.
* Real-time ray-tracing is applied (on 2D background for simplification, although raindrops are 3D).
